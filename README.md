# Text_Minning

Alogrithm used to create Hips and Zipf graph and to check the correctness of the laws.

The main file is in main_HZ. With this file you can check your document (or as many documents as you want!) and see does your document fulfill Heaps and Zip laws rules. 
Other files contains usefull classes and methods, which gives a tools to check meantioned laws.

The application is created of 5 files:

main_HZ.py: main script, used to conduct data preprocessing and testing Heaps and Zipf laws,
data_preprocessing: file contating methods used to "work" with data, "to clean" them. Mainly used to prepare data for further analysis,
Heaps_and_Zipf_laws.py: file contating all methods needed to calculate Heaps and Zipf parameters. Additionally methods inside class can be used to create useful graphs visualizing analized data.
